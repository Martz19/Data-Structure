COMP 315 - Introduction to data structures
Singly linked node
This class implements the singly linked list using templates
Each list has two attributes:
	-head: first node in the list
	-tail: last node in the list

Considerations:
1. head point to null in an empty list
2. There is not need of a tail pointer
